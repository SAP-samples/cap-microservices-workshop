# Exercise 01 - Project Structure, monorepos and git submodules


ðŸ‘‰ Initialize a solution repository

```sh
mkdir solution
cd solution
git init
npm init -y
```

This repository serves as the combining root of your solution. We are going to work inside this directory for the rest of the exercises.


ðŸ‘‰ Add a `.gitignore`

```
.DS_Store
node_modules
package-lock.json
```



ðŸ‘‰ Include the incidents application as a submodule

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app incidents
git submodule update --init
```

We now have the full code of the [incidents app](https://github.com/cap-js/incidents-app) in our solution repository.
There's also a `.gitmodules` file managing which repository belongs to which folder as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

```
solution
â”œâ”€â”€ incidents
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitmodules
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Using this setup, one team can work on the incidents-app repository independently. PRs and tests are also kept inside the incidents-app repository. At the same time, another team (we) can work on integrating the incidents-app with the overall solution.

ðŸ‘‰ Enable workspaces in the `package.json`:
```json
{
    ...
    "workspaces": ["*"]
}
```

[NPM workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/workspaces) provide a streamlined workflow for multiple linked npm packages.
In this case, we specify that every root level folder should be considered a workspace, but you can also specify concrete folders like `"workspaces": ["incidents", "utils/.../my-own-lib", ...]`.
It is then possible to reference the other packages as npm dependencies with automatically created symlinks. We will see this in a later exercise.


ðŸ‘‰ Install dependencies
```sh
npm i
```

Notice the install location. The `node_modules` folder with dependencies is located inside the `solution` directory instead of `incidents`.
This is because npm workspaces consolidate the dependencies, meaning that you don't have to install them separately for each project.

```
solution
â”œâ”€â”€ incidents
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _i18n
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ db
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSES
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ srv
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ xmpls
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cds-plugin.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ readme.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ REUSE.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules      <----
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```


ðŸ‘‰ Start the incidents application
```sh
cds w incidents
```

Navigating to http://localhost:4004/incidents/webapp/index.html, you see the familiar incidents app:
