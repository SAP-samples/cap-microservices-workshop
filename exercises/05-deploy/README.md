# Exercise 05 - Deploy the application


ðŸ‘‰ Log in to Cloud Foundry

For [re>â‰¡CAP 2025](https://recap-conf.dev/), you can use the prepared Cloud Foundry environment.

```sh
cf l -a https://api.cf.eu10-005.hana.ondemand.com --origin aoykcp1ee-platform
```

User: capworkshopuser+0xx@gmail.com (001 ... 040 is the range)  
Password: *** (shared in Workshop)

> If you work through this on your own, login via `cf login --sso` in a BTP trial account.

ðŸ‘‰ Deploy the application
```sh
cds up
```

This command includes multiple steps like `mbt build` and `cf deploy`. You can learn more in the [deploy documentation](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/deployment/to-cf#build-and-deploy).

Checking the command output, we see the executed steps in blue.

First the mbt build

```sh
$ cds up

mbt build -t gen --mtar mta.tar

...
```

This includes our custom `before-all` build steps. We should see the output of the build inside each gen folder:

```

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ router
â”œâ”€â”€ feedback

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gen     <---
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ srv
â””â”€â”€ srv
```

The result of the build is an `mta.tar` file which contains all our coding, files and configuration needed for deployment. As it is a tar file, you can also unpack it and look what's inside.

The next step is `cf deploy`

```sh
$ cds up

...

cf deploy gen/mta.tar -f

```

This uploads the `mta.tar` to Cloud Foundry, where the [multiapps controller](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/multiapps-controller) takes over and creates the service instances and applications based on what we defined in the `mta.yaml`.


ðŸ‘‰ Check the mta deployment
```sh
cf mta solution
```


We see both our incidents and our feedback app as microservices.

Alternatively, you can also see the apps or services using `cf services` and `cf apps`.

ðŸ‘‰ Visit the `solution` app

The url - or rather, the domain - is given as part of the output of the `cf apps` or `cf app solution` commands. It should look like this `<org>-<space>-solution.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com`. Copy this domain and paste it into your borwser.

> When using the provided Cloud Foundry space during [re>â‰¡CAP 2025](https://recap-conf.dev/), you may be prompted on how to sign in. Choose `aoykcp1ee.accounts.ondemand.com`.
> ![login screen](assets/login.png)

You should now be redirected to the `incidents/webapp/index.html` page. Remember that this is the `welcomeFile` we set inside the `xs-app.json` in the previous exercise.

![deployed incidents app](assets/deployed-app.png)


Since approuter acts as a proxy, we can also view the odata endpoints exposed by our applications. Visit the feedback odata endpoint by entering the path `/odata/v4/feedback/Feedback` after the domain.

![proxied odata endpoint](assets/proxied-endpoint.png)

ðŸ‘‰ Try out the application interactions

Just like in exercise 02 when running both applications together on the local system, create an incident in the application at `/incidents/webapp/index.html`.

The incident then also appears in the feedback application at `/give-feedback/index.html`.

This was the final exercise.

A [re>â‰¡CAP 2025 survey](https://url.sap/6rouc7) is available for CAP developers - please take a moment to complete it if you can. Thank you!
